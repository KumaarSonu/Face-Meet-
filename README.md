Are anonymous interruptions in your video meeting driving you crazy? Do you need a security solution that lets real people attend your meeting?

Do not worry; we have you covered. We now present Face Meet.

A GenZ video calling platform called Face Meet provides 2FA (Two Factor Authentication), which consists of face recognition and email password verification technology. Only those who have registered are allowed to join meetings after a successful image verification.

Therefore, before setting up a meet, a user must register on our site with an email address, a password, and a photo. Users who want to attend the meeting must complete the registration process as well. To ensure that a real individual really attended the meet, a face verification is done after registration.

Build with help of Face Recognition Library in Python, it gives an accuracy of 99.38%.

Want to host or join a meet, just register and you are good to go.
